    <h1>Learning by raising: How to start a VC fund with next to no experience</h1>
    <h2>Looking for a blog post with simple action points on how to change your career? You have come to the wrong place. Instead, we are going to equip you with something much more valuable. This blog is dedicated to interesting insights on developing a unique approach and making it in the world of startups and VCs, the two of which we have grown to love. But first, we will start with a story on how to do whatever you want with just a little bit of courage — something we would like to see happening even more in the Nordics.</h2>
    <h3>No one knows everything at the beginning. We at Wave Ventures believe that the best way to figure things out is to just start doing epic stuff with the most epic people. <br>
    We first got immersed in the startup ecosystem through working at Europe’s leading tech event Slush. Strong interest in the world of venture capital followed naturally, as we wanted to find a way to continue working with awesome teams and to keep our learning curve as steep as possible. We happened to bump into student-run VC funds in the States and started to wonder why there were hardly any of them in Europe, and none in the Nordics. At that moment, we decided to go ahead and give our idea a try. <br>
    We gathered an ambitious group of like-minded students, and together set a goal of trying to raise 1M€ for a pilot fund. And it started off as quite a ride indeed. Somehow, we managed to charm Timo Ahopelto, Ilkka Kivimäki, Ville Miettinen, Inka Mero, Moaffak Ahmed, Mårten Janson and Sten Tamkivi to become our advisors. Encouraged by the initial proof that we were not completely out of our minds, we went and knocked on the doors of the other Nordic serial entrepreneurs and VCs and got them, one by one, excited enough to make an investment in our crazy idea. <br>
    Fast-forward a year and a half, we now have in our hands Europe’s biggest student-driven VC fund, amounting to 1,2M€ and even exceeding the primary target of ours. One could even see Wave Ventures as our very own first startup. We definitely learned our first lessons on raising venture money and will now learn how to actually run a VC fund. <br>
    Wave Ventures is built on the boldest of ideas and most determined people pushing forward to learn more. Inspired by the great work of the people of Slush & co, our mission now is to do our part for the ecosystem and be among the very first ones to back up especially young founders. To help them climb their first peak and figure things out, we offer them pre-seed funding, crucial basic resources, guidance in team building, and connections to co-investors and follow-on funding for the most promising earliest stage startups in the Nordics. <br>
    A bold blend of ambitious young minds, experienced partners and venture capital. For more epic stories reach us at howdy@wave.ventures and check out www.wave.ventures!
